Active Work:
 - Movement should be free and the rest of the party should follow the active player when there are no active enemies
 - Better equipment and consumables spawning in the dungeon and on enemies

Unordered Roadmap:
 - Character overhaul, different character models that show their equipped equipment
 - Combat overhaul, spells, effects and ranged attacks
 - Dungeon features, such as doors, barrels, random stuff sitting around
 - Game win condition. Make it from the start room to the end room, the longest path of rooms in the dungeon
 - Room overhaul, make rooms more interesting and have purpose in the dungeon. Basically themed rooms with decorations
 - Dungeon overhaul, multiple floors with a surface to talk to NPCs
 - Quests and more of a surface world to explore

Side work:
 - Have FOV for each individual character, darkening outside. Make this efficient
   - Store a "current" fov in the FOV update, each time FOV.update is called we just clear current and then recalculate each tile 
     a player can see
 - More enemies and different AIs
 - Prettier subscreens and UI
 - Mousing over things changes the cursor (attacking and grabbing items)
 - Pick up items from the map screen

Bugs:
 - For some reason an enemy will just skip their turn, not sure why. It seems to happen when they are fully surrounded
   - I think they are trying to pathfind to an unreachable player somehow
