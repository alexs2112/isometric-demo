Active Work:

Unordered Roadmap:
 - Remaining weapon types + their skills
 - Room overhaul, make rooms more interesting and have purpose in the dungeon. Basically themed rooms with decorations
 - Dungeon overhaul, multiple floors with a surface to talk to NPCs
 - Quests and more of a surface world to explore
 - Experience and levelling up
 - More mouse controls, everything should be controllable by mouse, including many buttons around the screen and redoing
   most subscreens
 - Saving game state

Side work:
 - Prettier subscreens and UI
 - Mousing over things changes the cursor (attacking and grabbing items)
 - Pick up items from the map screen
 - Clean up how dungeons are generated to be optimized, passing a single World object around instead of like 5 variables
 - Inventory screen optimizations
   - Also allow you to pick up and move around a specific number of things, not just the max every time
 - Better Ranged Weapons:
   - When we shoot maybe return a projectile_path line, if there is one in main then just display the projectile on each tile
     of the path with a quick sleep in between to "animate" their movement
     - This has to be done quickly since the player will have no control while the projectile is moving, and slow would look weird
       anyway
   - You can quiver special arrows to automatically fire them, or just fire them via mouse click from inventory
      - Default quiver has no ammunition cost because that sucks in an rpg
 - Spellbook Icons:
   - I think we should do one book icon for each magic school/type/whatever, then have the spell icon in the bottom corner of the
     book icon
 - Spells with cooldowns, this is mostly ignored for now
 - Spells and effects need icons and indicators
 - A menu for the escape key so that id doesn't just immediately kill the game instead
 - Optimize party movement algorithm so they actually follow a path instead of just teleport around
 - Clean up wall shadows to use NE and NW separately (minor visual bug the current way). This is a little trickier than expected
   do to walls having thickness
 - Door shadows, only show shadow on one side of the door if you can't see the other
 - Right now AI can't open doors or path through them. But you also can't close doors mid combat. If we decide to let you close
   doors in combat, we will also have to let AI open doors
 - Chests:
   - A static inventory, needs to stay in the world even if empty
   - Maybe a closed icon for items, and an open icon if it is empty?
   - I can't draw this shit
 - We might want to add shadows to creatures again if it looks kind of funky without them
 - Make party movement better to work with animations. Right now you all just teleport. Not sure how to pathfind properly

Tech Debt:
 - Clean up dungeon_gen class to use a world object instead of passing around a million variables. Circular imports make this
   awkward
 - Im pretty sure assigning items an icon in the constructor doesn't actually matter
 - We can optimize drawing to the screen by caching a current section. We can blit to this section, and then blit the section
   to the screen. This way if we don't make changes we can simply blit this section every time without recalculating where
   everything needs to be
    - Small example with stats in the character screen

Known Bugs:
