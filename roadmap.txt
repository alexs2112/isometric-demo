Roadmap:
 - Better equipment and consumables spawning in the dungeon and on enemies
 - Character overhaul, different character models that show their equipped equipment
 - Combat overhaul, spells, effects and ranged attacks
 - Dungeon features, such as doors, barrels, random stuff sitting around
 - Game win condition. Make it from the start room to the end room, the longest path of rooms in the dungeon
 - Room overhaul, make rooms more interesting and have purpose in the dungeon. Basically themed rooms with decorations
 - Dungeon overhaul, multiple floors with a surface to talk to NPCs
 - Quests and more of a surface world to explore

Side work:
 - Have FOV for each individual character, darkening outside. Make this efficient
 - More enemies and different AIs
 - Prettier subscreens and UI

Bugs:
 - For some reason an enemy will just skip their turn, not sure why. It seems to happen when they are fully surrounded
