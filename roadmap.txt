Active Work:

Unordered Roadmap:
 - Dungeon Overhaul:
   - Up to 3 floors with increasing difficulty. Use staircases to traverse from one "world" to the next
   - Room overhaul, make rooms more interesting and have purpose in the dungeon. Basically themed rooms with decorations
 - Prettier subscreens and UI
   - New pickup subscreen
   - New skill subscreen
   - Escape key menu that doesn't immediately kill the game
   - UI buttons on the main screen to simulate keypresses
   - Mousing over things changes the cursor (attacking and grabbing items)
   - Redo main UI to have health, mana, and armor at the bottom along with an action bar
 - Combat Turn Order:
   - Display the turn order as a queue for the players and active enemies at the top of the screen
   - Maybe just have the entire list from 0 to end, then highlight the one who's currently active
 - Better Ranged Weapons:
   - You can quiver special arrows to automatically fire them, or just fire them via mouse click from inventory
      - Default quiver has no ammunition cost because that sucks in an rpg
 - Skill optimizations:
   - Skill Tome Icons:
     - I think we should do one book icon for each magic school/type/whatever, then have the skill icon in the bottom corner of the
       book icon
   - Probably redo how memorizing skills and preparing them work? Might be able to just remove the preparing system and only
     memorize skills that you have the stats for.
     - We can have items increase stats, so maybe also add this stat check in the `can_cast` method for skills
   - Reflavour cast to activate or something?
 - Effects:
   - Icons and indicators for active effects on creatures
   - Figure out how to make effects and cooldowns expire when out of combat. Maybe every X frames?
 - Action Bar Optimization:
   - Allow the player to rearrange stuff and assign other things to hotkeys
 - Shadow optimizations:
   - Clean up wall shadows to use NE and NW separately (minor visual bug the current way). This is a little trickier than expected
     do to walls having thickness
   - Door shadows, only show shadow on one side of the door if you can't see the other
   - We might want to add shadows to creatures again if it looks kind of funky without them
 - Chests:
   - A static inventory, needs to stay in the world even if empty
   - Maybe a closed icon for items, and an open icon if it is empty?
   - I can't draw this shit
 - We can possibly add a saving feature:
   - This will be a pain in the ass, but the way cached items work, it might not be that bad
 - Make party movement better to work with animations. Right now you all just teleport. Not sure how to pathfind properly
 - Animated Attacks: Figure out a way to not change game state (health and messages) until after the animation is done playing
   - Maybe cache changes and messages until after, then apply them?
 - Limit the number of messages that show up when out of combat
 - Allow the player to build their party of 4 out of a pool of available characters in the beginning
 - Different variations of base enemy sprites to make it a bit more unique
 - Clean up how enemies use skills to make it more elegant and powerful
 - Make equipping/unequipping stuff cost AP in combat

Tech Debt:
 - Clean up dungeon_gen class to use a world object instead of passing around a million variables. Circular imports make this
   awkward
 - We can optimize drawing to the screen by caching a current section. We can blit to this section, and then blit the section
   to the screen. This way if we don't make changes we can simply blit this section every time without recalculating where
   everything needs to be
    - Small example with stats in the character screen

Known Bugs:
 - Starting combat with a player that is not edward sometimes fucks up
 - Enemies that have lost the player no longer end their turn and deactivate, game just loops...
 - Sometimes the game randomly freezes in combat, not sure if it is a loop or if it will break out of it
