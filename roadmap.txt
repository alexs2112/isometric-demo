Active Work:
 - Initiative
   - CURRENTLY BREAKING IF AN NPC GOES FIRST
 - More types of weapons that utilize the new skill
 - Finish implementing all skills and attributes

Unordered Roadmap:
 - Combat overhaul
    - More enemies and different AIs
    - Possibly increase the armor cap
 - Dungeon features, such as doors, barrels, random stuff sitting around
 - Game win condition. Make it from the start room to the end room, the longest path of rooms in the dungeon
 - Room overhaul, make rooms more interesting and have purpose in the dungeon. Basically themed rooms with decorations
 - Dungeon overhaul, multiple floors with a surface to talk to NPCs
 - Quests and more of a surface world to explore
 - More mouse controls, everything should be controllable by mouse, including many buttons around the screen and redoing
   most subscreens
 - Saving game state

Side work:
 - Prettier subscreens and UI
 - Mousing over things changes the cursor (attacking and grabbing items)
 - Pick up items from the map screen
 - Magic system:
   - Spells have a element and level
   - Need to have the corresponding skill to be at least that level in order to learn it
   - Can only have prepared spells of total levels less than or equal to your spell slots
   - Can rest and reorganize your prepared spells, possibly only outside of a dungeon? Once we have an "outside"
 - Inventory screen optimizations
   - Allow the inventory screen to take multiple inventories as a param
     - Looting rooms with multiple inventories
     - Dropping items from multiple creatures at once
   - Also allow you to pick up and move around a specific number of things, not just the max every time
 - Better Ranged Weapons:
   - When we shoot maybe return a projectile_path line, if there is one in main then just display the projectile on each tile
     of the path with a quick sleep in between to "animate" their movement
     - This has to be done quickly since the player will have no control while the projectile is moving, and slow would look weird
       anyway
   - You can quiver special arrows to automatically fire them, or just fire them via mouse click from inventory
      - Default quiver has no ammunition cost because that sucks in an rpg
 - Spellbook Icons:
   - I think we should do one book icon for each magic school/type/whatever, then have the spell icon in the bottom corner of the
     book icon
 - Spells with cooldowns, this is mostly ignored for now
 - Spells and effects need icons and indicators
 - "Animate" movement, add a short delay between each tile of movement, redrawing the screen each time. But only if the creature
   is on screen
   - This will massively suck with party movement...
 - A menu for the escape key so that id doesn't just immediately kill the game instead
 - Optimize loading equipment images to make it less clunky with so much blank space (assets/items_equipped.png)

Known Bugs:
 - Sometimes an item on the ground will be None, but be listed in the inventory under its name without showing any details
   - Picking it up crashes the game (might not happen anymore)
   - It is possibly (likely) an indexing problem with the inventory screen
 - Party movement is a little broken, mostly works
