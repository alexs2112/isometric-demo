Active Work:

Unordered Roadmap:
 - Movement should be free and the rest of the party should follow the active player when there are no active enemies
 - Item overhaul, consumables, spawning in dungeon, more equipment
 - Character overhaul, different character models that show their equipped equipment
 - Combat overhaul, spells, effects and ranged attacks
 - Dungeon features, such as doors, barrels, random stuff sitting around
 - Game win condition. Make it from the start room to the end room, the longest path of rooms in the dungeon
 - Room overhaul, make rooms more interesting and have purpose in the dungeon. Basically themed rooms with decorations
 - Dungeon overhaul, multiple floors with a surface to talk to NPCs
 - Quests and more of a surface world to explore

Side work:
 - More enemies and different AIs
 - Prettier subscreens and UI
 - Mousing over things changes the cursor (attacking and grabbing items)
 - Pick up items from the map screen
 - Fix how weapons work, right now it just directly adds to a creatures base damage
   - Change base damage to some unarmed stat, then calculate attack based on equipped weapon OR unarmed
 - Ranged Weapons:
   - Draw a line (like a line line) from you to target if they are in range to show that they will be shot rather than
     moved towards and attacked
   - When we shoot maybe return a projectile_path line, if there is one in main then just display the projectile on each tile
     of the path with a quick sleep in between to "animate" their movement
      - This has to be done quickly since the player will have no control while the projectile is moving, and slow would look weird
        anyway
   - You can quiver special arrows to automatically fire them, or just fire them via mouse click from inventory
      - Default quiver has no ammunition cost because that sucks in an rpg
