Active Work:

Unordered Roadmap:
 - Dungeon Overhaul:
   - Room overhaul, make rooms more interesting and have purpose in the dungeon. Basically themed rooms with decorations
 - Prettier subscreens and UI
   - Escape key menu that doesn't immediately kill the game
   - Mousing over things changes the cursor (attacking and grabbing items)
   - Redo main UI to have health, mana, and armor at the bottom along with an action bar
   - Inspect enemy screen
 - Better Ranged Weapons:
   - You can quiver special arrows to automatically fire them, or just fire them via mouse click from inventory
      - Default quiver has no ammunition cost because that sucks in an rpg
 - Skill optimizations:
   - Skill Tome Icons:
     - I think we should do one book icon for each magic school/type/whatever, then have the skill icon in the bottom corner of the
       book icon
   - Probably redo how memorizing skills and preparing them work? Might be able to just remove the preparing system and only
     memorize skills that you have the stats for.
     - We can have items increase stats, so maybe also add this stat check in the `can_cast` method for skills
   - Reflavour cast to activate or something?
   - Let skills have multiple different stat requirements
 - Shadow optimizations:
   - Clean up wall shadows to use NE and NW separately (minor visual bug the current way). This is a little trickier than expected
     do to walls having thickness
   - Door shadows, only show shadow on one side of the door if you can't see the other
   - We might want to add shadows to creatures again if it looks kind of funky without them
 - Finalize levelling up:
   - Each character gets 1 attribute point to spend, before spending stat points
   - Each character also gets a choice of 3 perks per level that grant abilities and other bonuses.
     - Possibly the same perks for level 1->2, 2->3. So by the end each should have 2 of the 3 perks
   - Dead players are resurrected here, but miss out on levelling up
 - Chests:
   - A static inventory, needs to stay in the world even if empty
   - Maybe a closed icon for items, and an open icon if it is empty?
   - I can't draw this shit
 - We can possibly add a saving feature:
   - This will be a pain in the ass, but the way cached items work, it might not be that bad
 - Make party movement better to work with animations. Right now you all just teleport. Not sure how to pathfind properly
 - Animated Attacks: Figure out a way to not change game state (health and messages) until after the animation is done playing
   - Maybe cache changes and messages until after, then apply them?
 - Allow the player to build their party of 4 out of a pool of available characters in the beginning
 - Different variations of base enemy sprites to make it a bit more unique
 - Clean up how enemies use skills to make it more elegant and powerful
 - Make using items cost AP in combat
 - Make custom skill icons, effect icons, effect sprites
 - Add a few frames of delay at the end of AI turns
 - Minor effect icon to represent more than 2 concurrent effects
   - Only show at most 1 of each effect icon...
 - Loading a skill darkens each tile outside of range
 - Walking on open doors is permitted, right click them to close them
 - Increase the frame rate, add a helper function to calculate how many frames need to pass to count as seconds
 - Change Wizards unarmed to default, introduce Wand weapon that deals magic damage at a short range and increases stat of that type
    - Maybe deals a little more damage than the bow but costs mana to attack with
 - More exit buttons for subscreens to navigate with mouse
 - Make skill screen use more icons and look less ugly
 - Make the level up stats screen more obvious what it wants from you when it disables to continue button

Tech Debt:
 - Clean up dungeon_gen class to use a world object instead of passing around a million variables. Circular imports make this
   awkward
 - We can optimize drawing to the screen by caching a current section. We can blit to this section, and then blit the section
   to the screen. This way if we don't make changes we can simply blit this section every time without recalculating where
   everything needs to be
    - Small example with stats in the character screen
 - Character screen is getting pretty unwieldy, clean it up

Known Bugs:
 - Enemies that have lost the player no longer end their turn and deactivate, game just loops...
 - Casting skills (embers) and firing the bow sometimes cause the game to freeze?? Really not sure what is going on, I didnt touch that code
