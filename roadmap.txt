Active Work:

Unordered Roadmap:
 - Movement should be free and the rest of the party should follow the active player when there are no active enemies
 - Character overhaul, different character models that show their equipped equipment
 - Combat overhaul, spells, effects and ranged attacks
    - More equipment once we have ways to make them interesting and unique
 - Dungeon features, such as doors, barrels, random stuff sitting around
 - Game win condition. Make it from the start room to the end room, the longest path of rooms in the dungeon
 - Room overhaul, make rooms more interesting and have purpose in the dungeon. Basically themed rooms with decorations
 - Dungeon overhaul, multiple floors with a surface to talk to NPCs
 - Quests and more of a surface world to explore
 - More mouse controls, everything should be controllable by mouse, including many buttons around the screen and redoing
   most subscreens

Side work:
 - More enemies and different AIs
 - Prettier subscreens and UI
 - Mousing over things changes the cursor (attacking and grabbing items)
 - Pick up items from the map screen
 - Inventory screen optimizations
   - Allow the inventory screen to take multiple inventories as a param
     - Looting rooms with multiple inventories
     - Dropping items from multiple creatures at once
   - Also allow you to pick up and move around a specific number of things, not just the max every time
 - Ranged Weapons:
   - Draw a line (like a line line) from you to target if they are in range to show that they will be shot rather than
     moved towards and attacked
   - When we shoot maybe return a projectile_path line, if there is one in main then just display the projectile on each tile
     of the path with a quick sleep in between to "animate" their movement
     - This has to be done quickly since the player will have no control while the projectile is moving, and slow would look weird
       anyway
   - You can quiver special arrows to automatically fire them, or just fire them via mouse click from inventory
      - Default quiver has no ammunition cost because that sucks in an rpg

Known Bugs:
 - Sometimes an item on the ground will be None, but be listed in the inventory under its name without showing any details
   - Picking it up crashes the game
